Go (golang) support for Vim. It comes with pre-defined sensible settings (like auto gofmt on save), has autocomplete, snippet support, improved syntax highlighting, go toolchain commands, etc... If needed vim-go installs all necessary binaries for providing seamless Vim integration with current commands. It's highly customizable and each individual feature can be disabled/enabled easily.
